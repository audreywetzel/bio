            <p>We can imagine a world where people choose to be brave, who do the right thing even when it is incredibly hard and against all the odds and were often almost completely alone in doing it. Harry potter is one of the most brave characters I watched when I was younger. Seeing him battle and fight evil was very empowering for a little girl. </p>

          <p> The Harry Potter books and movies are all about witchcraft and wizardry. Harry Potter taught me how to use my imagination and believe in something magical that may be silly to most people. I think that when you are a little kid it is good to believe in fictional characters and ideas.  I love being able to believe in magic, and I have the Harry Potter series to thank for that. </p>

          <p> When I was younger I grew up reading and watching Harry potter. Hogwarts was always a place the students could go to explore, be creative, and care for one another. Growing up I have always liked learning new things and have always had the mindset of being kind to others at all times. It is safe to say I owe some of that to the Harry Potter series. </p>
